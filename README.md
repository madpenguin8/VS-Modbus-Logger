vs-modbus-logger
==============

VS Modbus Logger is designed to log operating parameters on Gardner Denver VS and VST series air compressors. It records some parameters for the motor data and pressures for the purpose of troubleshooting.

This version uses the serial interface of the comm module. I'm in the process of converting it to use Ethernet and will create a separate project for it.
